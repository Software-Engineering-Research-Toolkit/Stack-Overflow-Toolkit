# Stack-Overflow-Toolkit

[![Tool](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tool-Stack%20Overflow-orange.svg)](https://github.com/XBWer/Stack-Overflow-Toolkit)

## Goal of this repository
Since I frequently play with [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) (SO) data, I have written many data processing scripts. And I realized that those scripts are commonly used in different related project and maybe benefit to someone else like me to avoid reinventing the wheel. That's the idea this repository comes from.

## Directory Structure

So far the directory structure is quiet simple which is divided by program language.
It will be updated with the growth of the repository.
If you are unclear which directory should be put in for your code, you can put it in the `Tmp` first and I will make it in the right place later.

```
Root
└───DataDump
└───Python
└───Java
└───Tmp
└───README.md
└───Contributors.md
```

## You are welcomed to contribute
Please feel free to contribute your related and clean code to this repository. And I will put your Github username to the [contributor list](https://github.com/XBWer/Stack-Overflow-Toolkit/blob/master/Contributors.md). After you submit your code, I will further add your signature (e.g., name, time etc) to your code and merge it properly into the whole project. Thanks.
